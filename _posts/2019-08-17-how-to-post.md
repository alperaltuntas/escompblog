To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

To add new authors, add a new entry in ```_data/authors.yml``` file, e.g., as follows: 

```yaml
Billy Rick:
  name        : "Billy Rick"
  bio         : "What do you want, jewels? I am a very extravagant man."
  avatar: "/assets/images/bio-photo.jpg"
  links:
    - label: "Email"
      icon: "fas fa-fw fa-envelope-square"
      url: "mailto:billyrick@rick.com"
    - label: "Website"
      icon: "fas fa-fw fa-link"
      url: "https://thewhip.com"
    - label: "Twitter"
      icon: "fab fa-fw fa-twitter-square"
      url: "https://twitter.com/extravagantman"
```
