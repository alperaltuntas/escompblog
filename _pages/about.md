In 2005, The President’s Information Technology
Advisory Committee (PITAC) issued a report referring to
computation as a “third pillar” of science, placing it alongside
theory and experimentation. The ESCOMP blog is a platform for 
sharing ideas, experiences, and opinions on scientific software 
development and, in particular, earth system modeling. 


***Goals***:
- To promote best software engineering practices in scientific computing.
- To host reports and articles that are citable in scholarly publications.
- To ...

The ***scope*** of the blog includes, but not limited to:

 - Model development, testing and verification, software correctness, development environments, tools for visualization and analysis, automation tools, software carpentry, data science, optimization, programming languages and paradigms, high performance computing.

Posts are ***categorized*** in two main groups:
 - Blog
 - Tutorial

***Audience***:

 - Scientific software developers
 - Field experts, e.g, climate modelers
 - Graduate students
